# **Garmin (specifically fitness wearables)**


## Overview and Origin


* _Name of company_

Garmin

* _When was the company incorporated?_

Garmin was founded in October 1989.

* _Who are the founders of the company?_

Gary Burrell & Min Kao are co-founders of Garmin.

* _How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?_

Garmin originated as a company providing in-car navigational devices, marking the beginning of the end for foldable maps.  Their first fitness wearable, the Forerunner 101, started as an employee side project in 2003.  Source: Fortune.com.  Today, Garmin leverages GPS technology to the automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness markets.

* _How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?_

Garmin began publicly trading on NASDAQ on December 8, 2000.  Net sales (53-weeks ending December 31, 2022) for Garmin's Fitness segment was $1.3b (& $2.9b when including the Outdoor segment).  Source: Q4 2023 Garmin News Release.


## Business Activities


* _What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?_

Athletes were eager to use GPS technology to pinpoint the accuracy of their events.  Source: Fortune.com.  Generally, Garmin is interested in continuously innovating to ensure their customers "can make the most of the time they spend pursuing their passions."  Source: Garmin Brand Site. 

* _Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?_

Garmin designs products that fuel people's passions across the following segments: automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness markets.  While Garmin has been historically focused on niche segments, its competitors like Apple & Google have been tailoring their products to the masses.  

* _What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)_

Garmin plays to its midwestern strengths basing their corporate culture on hard work and humility, and knowing how to get the best out of its people, "constantly pushing people to their limits."  Additionally, Garmin focused on the need to grow, taking advantage of opportunities where they exist.  Further, they focused on precision rather than time-to-market: "seeing the pace at which things moved at Garmin was very different."  Lastly, Garmin has deep expertise on the customer groups they are serving.  "The team that is responsible for their cycling watch are professional cyclers.  The aviation team are pilots.  The secret sauce is understanding what the expert user wants."  Source: Fortune.com.

* _Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)_

Garmin bought Firstbeat Analytics, a Finnish company, in 2020 and started to release suggested workouts a few months later, so Garmin's machine learning algorithm leverages the data inputs collected via their wearable devices (e.g., recovery, sleep, etc.) to recommend a workout for the day.


## Landscape


* _What field is the company in?_

Garmin leverages its GPS technology to the automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness markets.  It's fitness and outdoor segments collectively is the top revenue generator, making up 58% of 2023 revenue.  Source: Garmin Brand Site.

* _What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?_

Enhancing wearables with AI has revolutionized sports performance tracking.  Not long ago performance tracking was limited to clipboards and stopwatches but now we have real-time data via smart wearables and further AI algorithms that provide immediate performance insights, allowing for real-time feedback and in turn real-time adjustments.  Amongst the many advantages of AI-powered wearables, what stands out the most is the customized training programs that are recommended.  Other benefits include: injury prevention, enhanced performance analysis, objective performance assessment, convenience and accessibility, and mental well-being support.  Source: Medium.  The size of the global wearable technology market was valued at $40.6b in 2020 and is expected to increase by 13.8% before 2028.  Source: NIH.

* _What are the other major companies in this field?_

Apple, Samsung, and Alphabet are amongst the leading competitors.  Source: Fortune.com.


## Results


* _What has been the business impact of this company so far?_

Garmin's watches make up just under 6% of the smartwatch market.  Garmin's Q4 2024 News Release reported out $2.9b in net sales for its Fitness/Outdoors segments (& $4.9b total).  Source: Fortune.com.

* _What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?_

Garmin publishes both their total revenue and operting income on their brand site and they assess performance compared to the prior year and quarter.  They achieved a 13% increase in consolidated revenue compared to the prior year quarter.  Additionally, they expect a 10% increase in revenue in 2024, compared to 2023.

* _How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?_

Overall, Garmin targets niche segments compared to its competitors.  Their competitive advantage has been their company values and business approach as mentioned above.


## Recommendations


* _If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)_

I think it would be great if Garmin could bridge various sports/activities and recommend well-rounded training programs.  For example, if I enjoy running, swimming, and weightlifting, how do I best schedule it all in without overtraining or doing too much?  Perhaps the input could be a goal (whether an event or a physical condition) and the AI-powered algorithm could help determine a plan/program and monitor progress towards achieving that/those goal(s).

Based on wearable technology trending towards increased availability, reduced costs, and introduction to new domains, data collection will continue to increase and design of data capture will only enhance the usability of data collected.  By inputting this data (and more) into machine learning systems, there could be new insights garnered to help evolve wearables along with the identification of new use cases to guide the evolution of wearables further.  

* _Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?_

This could perhaps create efficiencies from an organizational perspective.  There is a cost tradeoff to customizations/niche products.  Additionally, this could perhaps expand their consumer reach and perhaps help Garmin take the necessary small steps to try to narrow the gap vs. its competitors.
